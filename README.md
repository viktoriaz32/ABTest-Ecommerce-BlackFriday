# ABTest-Ecommerce-BlackFriday
Financial analysis and Black Friday A/B test for a simulated e-commerce supplement store. Python-generated data was used to gain insights into how hero image variants impact user engagement (clicks, conversions, etc.). The analysis is visualized and reported in Power BI.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following tables:

# STAR-Schema data model

## Objective
Three dashboard tabs were created during the project, each answering different business questions for the simulated supplement e-commerce store during Q4 2024.

Sales and Financial Overview

A/B test made it possible to evaluate which hero image (sports bra vs. long-sleeve top) leads to higher engagement and sales during the Black Friday campaign.

### 📌 Hypothesis
- **Variant A (Sports Bra)** will perform better by aligning with fitness-focused design trends.
- **Variant B (Long-Sleeve Top)** may appeal to audiences who prefer modesty and practicality.

### 🧪 Test Variants
- **Control (Variant A):** Hero image with a model wearing a sports bra.
- **Variation (Variant B):** Hero image with a model wearing a long-sleeve top.

### 📈 Key Metrics
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Conversion rate (CR)
- Bounce rate
- Average order value (AOV)

### 👥 Audience
- Simulated web traffic during the Black Friday period (Nov 24–28).
- Even 50/50 traffic split between variants.

### ⏳ Duration
- 5 days (Nov 24–28)

### 🛠️ Implementation
- Python was used to simulate data and generate A/B test metrics.
- Metrics include realistic CTR, CR, and bounce rates based on ecommerce benchmarks.
- Power BI used for interactive visualization and dashboard reporting.

### 📊 Analysis
- Statistical comparison of both variants’ performance.
- Key insights derived from differences in engagement and conversion behavior.
