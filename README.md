### Sales and Financial Overview

### Black Friday Impact Analysis

A/B test made it possible to evaluate which hero image (sports bra vs. long-sleeve top) leads to higher engagement and sales during the Black Friday campaign.

### üìå Hypothesis
- **Variant A (Sports Bra)** will perform better by aligning with fitness-focused design trends.
- **Variant B (Long-Sleeve Top)** may appeal to audiences who prefer modesty and practicality.

### üß™ Test Variants
- **Control (Variant A):** Hero image with a model wearing a sports bra.
- **Variation (Variant B):** Hero image with a model wearing a long-sleeve top.

### üìà Key Metrics
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Conversion rate (CR)
- Bounce rate
- Average order value (AOV)

### üë• Audience
- Simulated web traffic during the Black Friday period (Nov 24‚Äì28).
- Even 50/50 traffic split between variants.

### ‚è≥ Duration
- 5 days (Nov 24‚Äì28)

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation
- Python was used to simulate data and generate A/B test metrics.
- Metrics include realistic CTR, CR, and bounce rates based on ecommerce benchmarks.
- Power BI used for interactive visualization and dashboard reporting.

### üìä Analysis
- Statistical comparison of both variants‚Äô performance.
- Key insights derived from differences in engagement and conversion behavior.

### Customer and Product Analytics
